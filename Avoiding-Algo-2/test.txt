Algorithm: DeepFool Attack
Target Image: target1.jpg
Adversarial Image: adversarial_output_deepfool.jpg

Perturbation Technique: Iterative minimal perturbations to fool classifier
Overshoot: 18
Scaling Factor: 23
Max Iterations: 100
Number of Classes Considered: 5

Image Size: 224x224
Preprocessing: PyTorch transforms (Resize, ToTensor)
Libraries: PyTorch, TorchVision, NumPy, Matplotlib

Result:
- Verified: False
- Distance: 0.4128975189244517
- Model used for verification: DeepFace (Facenet)

Summary: 
The DeepFool adversarial attack successfully fooled the face recognition model.
The adversarial image appears visually similar to the original, 
but is no longer verified as the same identity by DeepFace (Facenet).
